## Sample for anchors and anchor persistence

[AnchorPersistenceSample.cs](Scripts/AnchorPersistenceSample.cs) demos the usage of ARFoundation to create free-world anchors,
and the usage of the [XRAnchorStore](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.mixedreality.openxr.xranchorstore?view=mixedreality-openxr-plugin-1.4) to persist these anchors across multiple sessions.

You can see the instruction of how to use this sample scene when running it on HoloLens2 or Mixed Reality headsets as illustrated in this picture below:
