Welcome!

These sample projects showcase features provided in the [Mixed Reality OpenXR Plugin for Unity](https://aka.ms/openxr-unity).

Features using AR Raycasts and AR Planes require the latest preview OpenXR runtime, which can be enabled using the OpenXR Developer Tools for Windows Mixed Reality. To install this app, search for "OpenXR" in the Microsoft Store app on HoloLens 2.
