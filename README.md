# OpenXR + Unity + Mixed Reality Samples

## Welcome!

![OpenXR-Unity-MixedReality-Samples-MainMenu](Readme/OpenXR-Unity-MixedReality-Samples-MainMenu.jpg)

These sample projects showcase how to build Unity applications
for HoloLens 2 or Mixed Reality headsets using the Mixed Reality OpenXR plugin.
For more details on installing related tools and setting up a Unity project,
please reference [the plugin documentation on https://docs.microsoft.com/](https://aka.ms/openxr-unity).

- Latest MRTK-Unity, recommended 2.7.3 or newer.
- Latest Windows Mixed Reality Runtime, recommended 109 or newer.

### Sample for anchors and anchor persistence

[AnchorsSample.cs](BasicSample/Assets/ARAnchor/Scripts/AnchorsSample.cs) in the ARAnchor scene
demos the usage of ARFoundation to create free-world anchors,
and the usage of the [XRAnchorStore](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/spatial-anchors-in-unity?tabs=anchorstore#persistent-world-locking) to persist these anchors between sessions.

### Sample for hand tracking

- [FeatureUsageHandJointsManager.cs](BasicSample/Assets/HandTracking/Scripts/FeatureUsageHandJointsManager.cs)
  in the HandTracking scene demos using Unity Feature Usages to obtain hand joint data.
- [OpenXRExtensionHandJointsManager.cs](BasicSample/Assets/HandTracking/Scripts/OpenXRExtensionHandJointsManager.cs)
  in the HandTracking scene demos the usage of the Mixed Reality OpenXR Extension APIs to obtain hand joint data.
- [HandMesh.cs](BasicSample/Assets/HandTracking/Scripts/HandMesh.cs)
  in the HandTracking scene demos the usage of hand meshes.

### Sample for eye tracking

[FollowEyeGaze.cs](BasicSample/Assets/Interaction/Scripts/FollowEyeGaze.cs) in the Interaction scene demos using Unity Feature Usages to obtain eye tracking data.

### Sample for locatable camera

[LocatableCamera.cs](BasicSample/Assets/LocatableCamera/Scripts/LocatableCamera.cs) in the LocatableCamera scene demos the setup and usage of the locatable camera.

### Sample for ARFoundation compatibility

Scenes [ARAnchor](BasicSample/Assets/ARAnchor), [ARRaycast](BasicSample/Assets/ARRaycast), [ARPlane](BasicSample/Assets/ARPlane),
and [ARMesh](BasicSample/Assets/ARMesh) are all implemented using ARFoundation, backed in this project by OpenXR plugin on HoloLens 2.

- Find planes using [ARPlaneManager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARPlaneManager.html)
- Place holograms using [ARRaycastManager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARRaycastManager.html).
- Display meshes using [ARMeshManager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.0/api/UnityEngine.XR.ARFoundation.ARMeshManager.html)

### Sample for Azure Spatial Anchors

[SpatialAnchorsSample.cs](AzureSpatialAnchorsSample/Assets/Scripts/SpatialAnchorsSample.cs) in the [Azure Spatial Anchors sample project](AzureSpatialAnchorsSample) demos saving and locating spatial anchors. For more information on how to set up the Azure Spatial Anchors project, see the [readme](AzureSpatialAnchorsSample) in the project's folder.

### Sample for Holographic Application Remoting

[AppRemotingSample.cs](BasicSample/Assets/AppRemoting/Scripts/AppRemotingSample.cs) in the Main Menu scene demos app remoting. For more information on how to set up the Basic Sample project for App Remoting, see the [readme](BasicSample/Assets/AppRemoting/README.md) in the project's folder.
